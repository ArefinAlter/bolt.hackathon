# Key Features: Dokani Platform (Hackathon Demo)

This document highlights the standout features of the Dokani platform, designed to provide a robust, intelligent, and scalable B2B returns solution. **This is a simulation-focused demo for hackathon purposes.**

## 1. Direct Portal Access
Dokani provides a seamless return experience through direct access to the Return/Refund Portal. Customers can initiate returns through a unique link that provides immediate access to the AI-powered return process, reducing friction and streamlining the customer experience.

- **Technology**: Next.js, Supabase Edge Functions

## 2. Dynamic, Multi-Flow Triage System
At the heart of Dokani is an intelligent Triage System that assesses each return request and automatically routes it down one of three paths:
- **Instant Approval Flow**: For low-risk, policy-compliant requests.
- **Human Review Flow**: For complex or high-value cases requiring merchant judgment.
- **Automatic Denial Flow**: For clear policy violations.

This ensures efficiency for the business and fast, clear outcomes for the customer.

- **Technology**: Supabase Edge Functions, OpenAI GPT-4o

## 3. Interactive Return & Refund Portal
Customers receive a unique link to a modern, single-page portal built with Next.js. This portal features:
- **An AI-powered chat interface** for conversational information gathering.
- **A real-time visual timeline** that shows the customer the exact status of their case from initiation to completion.
- **Simulated refund processing** for complete workflow demonstration.

- **Technology**: Next.js, Supabase Realtime, Tailwind CSS

## 4. Advanced Policy Management System
Dokani empowers merchants with granular control over their return logic through a powerful dashboard. Key capabilities include:
- **Visual Policy Editor**: An intuitive interface to define general rules, product-category-specific rules, and auto-approval thresholds.
- **Policy Versioning**: Policies can be versioned, tested in a simulation, and scheduled for activation, with a full history and rollback capability.

- **Technology**: Next.js, Supabase (PostgreSQL with JSONB)

## 5. AI-Powered Agents (GPT-4o)
The platform utilizes two distinct AI agents to manage the workflow:
- **Customer Service Agent**: A customer-facing conversational agent that handles information collection with an empathetic and professional tone.
- **Triage Agent**: A backend agent that analyzes the case against business policies, assesses risk, and determines the appropriate workflow, providing recommendations for human reviewers.

- **Technology**: OpenAI GPT-4o, Supabase Edge Functions

## 6. Business Dashboard with AI-Assisted Review
Merchants get a comprehensive dashboard to monitor all return activities. A key feature is the **Review Queue** for cases flagged for human review. Here, merchants can see all case details alongside the Triage Agent's recommendation and confidence score, enabling faster, more consistent decisions.

- **Technology**: Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui

## 7. Secure and Scalable Architecture
The platform is built on a modern, serverless stack designed for security and scalability. The conceptual **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server layer** ensures that communication between AI agents and core systems is secure, structured, and auditable.

- **Technology**: Supabase (Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions), Next.js

## 8. Voice & Video Capabilities
The platform features multimodal communication capabilities. Integrations with **ElevenLabs (voice)** and **Tavus (video)** allow the AI agents to handle customer interactions via voice notes or video calls, and respond in the same medium for a highly engaging and accessible experience.

- **Technology**: ElevenLabs API, Tavus API, Real-time Communication

## 9. Demo-Optimized Experience
Designed specifically for hackathon demonstration:
- **Simulated Refund Processing**: Complete return workflow demonstration without payment complexity
- **Seamless Role Switching**: Single user can experience both business and customer perspectives
- **Real-time AI Interaction**: Live conversations and decision making for compelling demos
- **Pre-populated Demo Data**: Realistic test scenarios for immediate demonstration
