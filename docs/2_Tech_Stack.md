## 2. Core Components

| Component              | Technology                                   | Rationale                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Frontend**           | **Next.js (React Framework)**                | Industry standard for building fast, SEO-friendly React applications. Provides a great developer experience with features like file-based routing and server-side rendering. |
| **Styling**            | **Tailwind CSS**                             | A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development without writing custom CSS. Perfect for building a modern UI quickly for a hackathon.      |
| **Backend-as-a-Service** | **Supabase**                                 | An open-source Firebase alternative. It provides a Postgres database, authentication, instant APIs, and storage out-of-the-box. Its generous free tier is ideal for this project. |
| **Deployment**         | **Netlify**                                  | Offers seamless, continuous deployment directly from a GitHub repository. Its integration with Next.js is top-notch, and it handles environment variables securely. |

## 3. AI & Machine Learning

| Component                   | Service                               | Rationale                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core AI Logic**           | **OpenAI GPT-4o**                     | State-of-the-art for powering the conversational AI agents (Customer Service and Triage). Essential for understanding requests and making policy-based decisions. |
| **Payment Processing**      | **Simulation Only**                   | For hackathon demo purposes, refund processing will be simulated rather than integrated with actual payment systems. This allows for full workflow demonstration without payment complexity. |
| **Voice Generation**        | **ElevenLabs**                        | Provides high-quality, natural-sounding text-to-speech, enabling the AI agent to handle voice calls and respond with audio. |
| **Video Generation**        | **Tavus**                             | Creates personalized, AI-driven video messages to customers at key points in the return process, enhancing engagement. |

## 4. Development & Operations

| Component               | Tool                                  | Rationale                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code Editor**         | **Cursor**                            | AI-powered code editor to accelerate development.                                                                           |
| **Version Control**     | **Git & GitHub**                        | Standard for source code management and collaboration. Essential for tracking changes and deploying to Netlify.               |
| **Package Manager**     | **npm**                               | Comes with Node.js. Used to install and manage all project dependencies (e.g., React, Tailwind CSS).                        |

## 5. Demo-Specific Considerations

### 5.1 Simulation vs. Production
- **Return Processing**: Simulated refund workflow for demo purposes
- **Payment Integration**: Mock payment processing to demonstrate the complete user journey
- **Social Media**: Demo focuses on direct portal access rather than social media integration
- **Workflow Automation**: Manual workflow management for demo simplicity

### 5.2 Hackathon Optimizations
- **Rapid Development**: Focus on core AI functionality and user experience
- **Demo Data**: Pre-populated with realistic test scenarios
- **Single User Experience**: Seamless switching between business and customer roles
- **Real-time Interaction**: Live AI conversations and decision making
